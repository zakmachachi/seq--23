# Daisy kick firmware

Daisy Seed kick/audio firmware copied unchanged from `DaisyExamples/files (1)/midi_oled_monitor.cpp`. This is separate firmware from the Teensy controller in the parent project's `src/` directory. Build it with Make, not PlatformIO.

## Build

Requires GNU Make, the ARM embedded GCC toolchain (`arm-none-eabi-g++`), and built libDaisy/DaisySP dependencies. Dependencies and generated binaries are not included in this folder.

The Makefile defaults to `../libDaisy` and `../DaisySP`, relative to this folder. Override these paths to use an existing DaisyExamples checkout:

```sh
make -C daisy-kick \
  LIBDAISY_DIR="/path/to/DaisyExamples/libDaisy" \
  DAISYSP_DIR="/path/to/DaisyExamples/DaisySP"
```

The local dependency revisions when this source was imported were:

- libDaisy: `9498417add4a4c76bc10737d5e9f43750a4da639`
- DaisySP: `a0494a3adb67f549e18dfd71a35fa656f65b38b6`

Initialize dependency submodules and build the libraries before building this application if using a fresh checkout. The outputs are generated under `daisy-kick/build/`, with target name `midi_oled_monitor`.

This import preserves the existing DSP, MIDI mapping, and hardware setup in the source. Consult its hardware and MIDI initialization sections before wiring or changing mappings. The Teensy controller's mapping is documented separately in [KICK_MENU2.md](../KICK_MENU2.md); this import does not change or reconcile the two implementations.
